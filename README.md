# ðŸŽ¥ Video Search and Upload Bot

A Python-based asynchronous bot that searches for videos on Instagram, monitors a directory for new video files, uploads them to a server using APIs, and manages local file cleanup. 

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Search & Download**: Finds videos on Instagram based on keywords and downloads them.
- **Directory Monitoring**: Watches the `/videos` folder for new `.mp4` files.
- **Asynchronous Upload**: Efficiently uploads videos to a server using pre-signed URLs.
- **Post Creation**: Creates a post on the server after upload.
- **Auto Cleanup**: Deletes videos locally after successful uploads.
